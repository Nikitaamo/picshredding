# Image Shredding Project

## Introduction

This project introduces a Python-based image manipulation tool that "shreds" images by rearranging their parts either horizontally or vertically. Aimed at beginners and enthusiasts alike, it serves as an engaging way to explore basic image processing concepts. The shredder is designed with simplicity in mind, allowing for easy customization and experimentation.

## Example Output

Below are examples of an image before and after applying the shredding effect:

### Before Shredding

![Before Shredding](/path/to/before_image.jpg)

### After Shredding

![After Shredding](/path/to/after_image.jpg)

*Note: Replace `/path/to/before_image.jpg` and `/path/to/after_image.jpg` with the actual paths to your images.*

## Project Structure

- `image_shredder.py`: The core script that implements the image shredding logic.
- `requirements.txt`: Specifies all the Python libraries needed to run the script.
- `IMG1.jpg`: An example image that can be used to demonstrate the script's capabilities.
- `.gitignore`: Configures which directories and files Git should ignore.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project, including setup, usage, and customization instructions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

#### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-shredding-project.git
Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional)
It's a good practice to create a virtual environment for Python projects to manage dependencies effectively.

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
# Then activate it:
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS and Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
Install Dependencies
With the virtual environment activated, install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Project

To run the image shredder and see it in action, execute:

bash
Copy code
python image_shredder.py
This will apply the shredding effect to IMG1.jpg and display the results.

Customizing the Effect

You can modify image_shredder.py to change the source image or adjust the shredding parameters:

Change url in the script to download a different image.
Adjust strip_height and strip_width to vary the size of the shredded strips.
